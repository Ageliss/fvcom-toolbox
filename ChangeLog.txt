20130403
--------

fvcom_prepro:
    add_river_nodes_list.m
        * Minor changes to code style.
    add_sponge_nodes_list.m
        * Fix bug which ignores constant sponge radius.
    add_stations_list.m
        * Add message about the outcome if no stations were within the domain.
    add_var_FVCOM_river.m
        * Turn warnings back on.
    example_FVCOM_tsobc.m
        * Add the global NetCDF history variable which includes a reference to
        the FVCOM toolbox.
    example_FVCOM_wind_ts.m
        * Turn warnings back on.
    example_FVCOM_wind_ts_speed.m
        * Turn warnings back on.
    example_init_lag.m
        * Turn warnings back on.
    get_FVCOM_rivers.m
        * Extract positions from the FVCOM-adapted POLCOMS rivers files. The
        POLCOMS positions are too coarse (12km) to be useful for FVCOM. As
        such, this function reads an ASCII file of positions and extracts the
        station's discharge data from the POLCOMS file.
    get_NCEP_forcing.m
        * Adds support for MATLAB's native OPeNDAP tools. Also fixes the
        calculation of net surface heat flux.
    get_POLCOMS_meanflow.m
        * Interpolate mean flow from POLCOMS output at the FVCOM open
        boundaries.
    get_POLCOMS_netCDF.m
        * More code outside the verbose section so it is executed even if
        verbose output is disabled.
    get_POLCOMS_rivers.m
        * Parse the POLCOMS rivers data file.
    get_POLCOMS_tsobc.m
        * Change the vertical interpolation to be scaled within the
        POLCOMS depth range for the current node. The net result is that the
        vertical profiles are squashed or stretched to fit within the FVCOM
        depths. This means the full profile structure is maintained in the
        resulting FVCOM boundary input despite the differing depths at the
        FVCOM boundary node.
    nodes2elems.m
        * Minor changes to coding style.
    read_ERA_wind.m
        * Turn warnings back on.
    read_NCEP_wind.m
        * Turn warnings back on.
    write_FVCOM_bedflag.m
        * Turn warnings back on.
    write_FVCOM_elevtide.m
        * Minor changes to coding style.
    write_FVCOM_forcing.m
        * Export of the surface forcing can now use a precomputed surface heat
        flux rather than having to interpolate the four components only to
        merge them (see write_FVCOM_forcing.m)
    write_FVCOM_meanflow.m
        * Preliminary support for mean flow at the open boundaries. At the
        moment, the mean flow is interpolated from POLCOMS daily mean flow
        values. The necessary tools to write out the FVCOM ASCII mean flow
        files have been created, but I have not yet managed to successfully
        run a model with mean flow. Consider it a work in progress.
    write_FVCOM_meanflow_ascii.m
        * Outputs the results of write_FVCOM_meanflow.m to ASCII for use in
        FVCOM.
    write_FVCOM_obs_TS.m
        * Add the global NetCDF history variable which includes a reference to
        the FVCOM toolbox.
    write_FVCOM_restart.m
        * The routine to replace variables within an FVCOM restart file now
        includes the ability to adjust the times for which the restart file is
        applicable. This is useful if you have a restart file for a model
        domain, but wish to use it for a different time.
    write_FVCOM_river.m
        * The existing river functions have been updated to reflect the
        changes needed in the latest versions of FVCOM (3.1.x). This has also
        been updated to use MATLAB's native NetCDF routines.
    write_FVCOM_river_nml.m
        * New function to write out the name list for the rivers in the model
        domain.
    write_FVCOM_spectide.m
        * Add the global NetCDF history variable which includes a reference to
        the FVCOM toolbox.
    write_FVCOM_sponge.m
        * Fix bug which ignores constant sponge radius.
    write_FVCOM_stations.m
        * Minor change to the error message for the incorrect number of
        arguments.
    write_FVCOM_tsobc.m
        * Add the global NetCDF history variable which includes a reference to
        the FVCOM toolbox. Also enable warnings.
    write_FVCOM_wind_ts_speed.m
        * Add the global NetCDF history variable which includes a reference to
        the FVCOM toolbox. Also enable warnings.
    write_FVCOM_z0.m
        * Add the global NetCDF history variable which includes a reference to
        the FVCOM toolbox. Also enable warnings.

utilities:
    centroid.m
        * Fix problem with checking the input arguments.
    find_boundary_elements.m
        * New utility to find the element numbers which run along the open
        boundary (needed for the mean flow).
    fix_inside_boundary.m
        * A new function to reorganise open boundary elements to have an edge
        approximately normal to the open boundary has been added
        (fix_inside_boundary.m). The routine is somewhat brute force, and can
        result in invalid unstructured grids. As such, any changes should be
        reviewed in SMS prior to being used in a model run.
    grid2fvcom.m
        * Improve the documentation.
    write_SMS_2dm.m
        * Export unstructured grid data from MATLAB to SMS format.
    write_SMS_cst.m
        * Export open boundary from MATLAB to SMS format.

        to the function. Follows the same syntax as add_sponge_nodes.m.

    add_stations_list.m:
        * New function: Add a set of stations at which FVCOM will output time
        series. Requires station coordinates and names, and a threshold
        distance beyond which the station is skipped.

    calc_sponge_radius.m:
        * New function: Create sponge layer with variable width radius based on
        the proximity of the closest element or 100km (whichever is smaller).

    estimate_ts.m:
        * Add arguments to the function so that the estimated current velocity
        and tidal range aren't hard-coded in the function.
        * Also add a crude conversion from lat/long distances to UTM (metres)
        using a great circle appoximation.

    example_FVCOM_tsobc.m:
        * Convert the method of writing NetCDF files from third-party toolbox
        to the MATLAB native version.
        * Add arguments to set dynamic file names (rather than hard-coded).

    example_FVCOM_wind_ts_speed.m:
        * Minor code change to calculate the number of elements in an array.

    get_AMM.m:
        * New function: Extract boundary forcing information from NOC
        Operational Tide Surge Model output.

    get_HYCOM_forcing.m:
        * New function: INCOMPLETE! Function to extract boundary forcing

    get_POLCOMS_tsobc.m:
        * New function: Extract temperature and salinity data from the PML
        POLCOMS NetCDF files and interpolate them to the FVCOM open boundary
        nodes.

    get_POLPRED_spectide.m:

    read_sms_mesh.m:
        * Add the ability to extract open boundaries from the defined
        nodestrings in the SMS grid file (.2dm).
        * Note: the SMS grid name must be a single word (no spaces). If the
        script fails to load your grid, chances are its name is "Default
        Coverage". If you change it to omit spaces in either the .2dm file or
        the SMS project, this script should work.

    replace_FVCOM_restart_vars.m:
        * New function: For a given FVCOM restart file, replace select variables
        with values from a PML POLCOMS model NetCDF output file. POLCOMS data

        surface elevations.

    write_FVCOM_forcing.m:
        * New function: Write forcing data (u and v winds, heat flux etc.) out
        to NetCDF file(s) depending on specified FVCOM version.

    write_FVCOM_obs_TS.m:
        * Converted to use MATLAB native NetCDF routines.

fvcom-postproc:
    example_surface_plot.m:
        * Now includes a lot more examples of different types of surface plots
        (e.g. vectors at specific layers).

utilities:

    centroid.m:
        * New function: Calculate the centroid of a given polygon.

    connectivity.m:
        * New function: From Mesh2D toolbox. Read unstructured grid
        connectivity (useful to find grid boundary, for example).

    deg2utm.m:
        * New function: Convert from lat/long to UTM (but automatically
        determine relevant UTM zone). See also wgs2utm (where UTM zone can be
        forced).
