Pierre Cazenave <pica@pml.ac.uk> fvcom-toolbox ChangeLog

fvcom-prepro:
    set_spectide.m:
        * Replace hard-coded variables with arguments to function call.
        * Add support for adding equilibrium amplitudes and beta love numbers.

    write_FVCOM_spectide.m:
        * Replace use of external NetCDF library with MATLAB native tools.
        * Add support for writing out equilibrium amplitudes and beta love numbers.

    set_elevtide.m:
        * New function to write out timeseries of surface elevations to a NetCDF
        file. Currently writes a broken file (or at least, I didn't manage to get
        FVCOM to run a model successfully with this input file).

        * Requires the Tide Model Driver MATLAB Toolbox from Oregon State
        University at http://polaris.esr.org/ptm_index.html.

    write_FVCOM_elevtide.m
        * New function to accompany set_elevtide.m to output a time series of
        surface elevations. Note - pretty certain this isn't writing exactly the
        write format just yet. If you fix it, let me know.

    write_FVCOM_tsobc.m:
        * Create a new function to output constant temperature and salinity at the
        open boundaries. Based on the example_FVCOM_tsobc.m file.

    read_sms_mesh.m:
        * Add the ability to extract open boundaries from the defined nodestrings
        in the SMS grid file (.2dm).
        * Note - the SMS grid name must be a single work (no spaces). If the script
        failes to load your grid, chances are its name is "Default Coverage". If
        you change it to "mesh" in either the .2dm file or the SMS project, this
        script should work.

    estimate_ts.m:
        * Add arguments to the function so that the estimated current velocity and
        tidal range aren't hard-coded in the function.
        * Also add a crude conversion from lat/long distances to UTM (metres)
        using a great circle appoximation.


fvcom-postproc:
    example_surface_plot.m:
        * Now includes a lot more examples of different types of surface plots
        (e.g. vectors at specific layers).

utilities:
    do_residual.m:
        * Calculate the residual vector for a given 2D time series.

    do_residual_plot.m:
        * Use the output of do_residual.m to plot residual vectors.

    do_transect_plot.m:
        * Pick and plot a transect through model output.

    deg2utm.m:
        * Function to convert from lat/long to UTM.
        * From http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/10915

    utm2deg.m:
        * Function to convert from UTM to lat/long.
        * From http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/10914
