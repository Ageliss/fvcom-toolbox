fvcom-toolbox
=============

The fvcom-toolbox is a collection of MATLAB and some FORTRAN90 scripts for the purpose of preparing and postprocessing data from the Finite Volume Community Ocean Model (FVCOM). These include:

1. Scripts for preparing input files for FVCOM (wind forcing, open boundary forcing, river forcing, etc.)
2. Scripts for converting meshes from SMS to FVCOM
3. Scripts for postprocessing FVCOM data using MATLAB
4. Scripts for preparing data for the unstructured SWAN model

Note that html based documentation is generated using m2html and is available with the download (see doc/index.html)

Some third-party MATLAB toolboxes are required for some functions:

* The air-sea toolbox available at http://woodshole.er.usgs.gov/operations/sea-mat/air_sea-html/index.html.
* The OPeNDAP toolbox (for versions of MATLAB older than 2011b) available at http://www.opendap.org/pub/contributed/source/ml-toolbox/.
